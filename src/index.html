    <h2>Q</h2>
    <div>
     <strong>Why do you need my email?</strong>
     <p>
      Most web requests finish in under a second so the server can directly respond to the
      client with whatever data was requested; however, finding the
      highest scoring word is hard and it takes the server longer to finish than it takes for the
      connection between server and client to time-out. Therefore I need a
      different way to get the response data to the user. There are lots of fancy ways to do this
      but the simplest is to just use email which is what I'm doing.
     </p>

    <div>
      <strong>How long does it take?</strong>
      <p>
        I'm not paying for a designated server so it can take 10-15 seconds for the server
        to wake up and then 20-30 seconds to find the highest scoring word.
        I'm using gmail for the last step so overall it's about 45 seconds.
      </p>

    <div>
      <strong>will my email be stored in a database and/or distributed?</strong>
      <p>
        technically gmail has a record of the sent email but other than that, no.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <strong>Can my rack/board have blanks?</strong>
      <p>
        Not right now but if enough people request it I might add that features.

      <strong>How can I request new features or report a problem?</strong>

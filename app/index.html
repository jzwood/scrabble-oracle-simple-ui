Therefore I need a different way to get the response data to the user. There are lots of fancy ways to do this but the simplest is to just use email which is what I'm doing. </p> </div> <hr> <div> <strong>How long does it take?</strong> <p> I'm not paying for a designated server so it can take 10-15 seconds for the server to wake up and then 20-30 seconds to find the highest scoring word. I'm using gmail for the last step so overall it's about 45 seconds. </p> </div> <hr> <div> <strong>will my email be stored in a database and/or distributed?</strong> <p> technically gmail has a record of the sent email but other than that, no. </p> </div> <hr> <div> <strong>Can my rack/board have blanks?</strong> <p> Not right now but if enough people request it I might add that feature. </p> </div> <hr> <div> <strong>How can I request new features or report a problem?</strong> <p> <a href="https://github.com/jzwood/scrabble-oracle-simple-ui/issues/new">https://github.com/jzwood/scrabble-oracle-simple-ui/issues/new</a> </p> </div> </aside> <script src="src.4f809411.js"></script> </body></html>
